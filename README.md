Kplus712 Business Knowledge - Dynamic Edition

Files included:
- business-knowledge.html
- stages.json
- notices.json

How it works:
- Open business-knowledge.html from the same folder (or upload to GitHub Pages).
- The page loads stages.json to render 5 cards with real images.
- It also loads notices.json and displays today's notice (based on day-of-year) and earlier notices up to today.
- To publish: upload these three files to your GitHub Pages repository (same folder as index.html).
